# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-06

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Facebook._

_Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:_

    . (period) which matches any single character
    * (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element

_That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression._

_For example, given the regular expression "ra." and the string "ray", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "raymond" should return false._

_Given the regular expression ".*at" and the string "chat", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false._
